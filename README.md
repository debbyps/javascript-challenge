# javascript-challenge

Summary of work: 
The purpose of this challenge is to gather UFO sighting data and display the data in table rows on a webpage. I am using the starter code provided. 

I chose to use the object constructor to create the necessary table for the unfiltered table.  I interpreted the need to render an initial table on the load of the page. Later in the code, the table will be filtered based on user entry of a filter date.
